# Example environment variables / secrets for GitHub Actions deploy workflow
# These should be stored in the repository's GitHub Actions Secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions)

# SSH
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
EC2_USER=ec2-user
EC2_HOST=your.ec2.ip.or.hostname
KNOWN_HOSTS=github.com,192.30.255.112 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ...   # optional

# Remote path on the EC2 host where project will be uploaded
REMOTE_PATH=/home/ec2-user/projects/skinet

# Notes
# - Add the SSH_PRIVATE_KEY to GitHub secrets as SSH_PRIVATE_KEY (no newlines replaced required when added via web UI)
# - Add EC2_USER, EC2_HOST, and REMOTE_PATH as secrets as well.
# - The action uses node:slim to be compatible with 'act' local runner.
